# TOR-JackalOnly

This TOR Plugin is not mine, it's been maid by EndOfFile#1141, more info on their discord server.

Due to multiple people asking about it, I made a small addon which allows slightly more options with Impostor Numbers.
Instead of allowing 1-3, it now allows 0-4.
To allow 0 Impostors you have to have at least 1 neutral role and Jackal on 100%
(Should only really be required by the Lobby host)
